                    Hi! My name is Om Kelkar (she/her).

                <div class="about">
                  <p>
                    Currently, I'm a software engineer working on distributed tracing at <a href="https://www.meta.com">Meta</a>.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Previously, I was on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/insights">Microsoft Viva Insights</a> team empowering workers to reclaim their time. And before that, I was a student who had just learned what a program was! Computers are cool.  
                </p>
                <p>
                   Outside of the office, I love to explore the infinite restaurants in NYC and ride bikes. Bikes are also very cool.
               </p>
