                    Currently, I'm a software engineer working on <a href="https://atscaleconference.com/ipnext-metas-next-generation-inference-platform/">AI/ML Deployment+Serving Infrastructure</a> at Meta, turning big blobby binary models into queryable web services. Nobody knows what's inside, but it's provocative. It gets the people going.

                   Previously, I worked on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~jcmace/papers/kaldor2017canopy.pdf">distributed tracing and context propagation</a> at Meta and as a full-stack engineer on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/insights">Microsoft Viva Insights</a> team.
                   Before all that, I was a student just learning what a program was. Computers are cool.

                   Outside of the office, I love to explore the infinite restaurants in NYC, do photography, and ride bikes. Bikes are also very cool. Sometimes I <a href="https://www.cycleblaze.com/journals/omridestocanada/">write about my trips by bike</a>.
